My name is Nicolás Castellán. I've mostly done ad hoc and hobbyist programming. I'm an entirely self-taught programmer, but after a couple years of doing this I've picked up some things.

I'm currently working on an open source simulation of the Boeing 787 for the open source flight simulator FlightGear. I've also recently started using Rust for most of my projects, I'm still learning it (and frankly, as with any language, you're always learning it), but it's going well.

- I created and maintain the VS Code extension [Linux Desktop File Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nico-castell.linux-desktop-file).
- I also maintain the repositories [PopOS-Setup](https://github.com/nico-castell/PopOS-Setup), and [Fedora-Setup](https://github.com/nico-castell/Fedora-Setup). Pop!\_OS and Fedora Linux are linux distros, and the repositories contain scripts to quickly get going after installing them.
- I wrote quite a few password generators, it's what I do when I learn a programming language 🤷‍♂️. I've written [genpass3](https://github.com/nico-castell/genpass3) using **Rust**, [genpass2](https://github.com/nico-castell/genpass2), using **C**, and [Genpass4Win](https://github.com/nico-castell/Genpass4Win) using **C#** (this is the one with a GUI).
